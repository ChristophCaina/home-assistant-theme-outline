# the old outline theme... radius 4 no shadow

# This is probably the most minimalistic theme out there.
#
# It respects almost all design choices and colors from Home Assistant, except
# one... the border/layering of the cards.
#
# This theme makes everything just a little tiny bit more modern, consistent
# and tight.
